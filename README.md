Prompts are essential. To help your app get even better at natural language understanding (and validation), we collected a few prompts aimed at helping make your app robust, secure, and not get hallucinated.

If you find these prompts helpful, please don't hesitate to give us a ⭐star! That way I can get some coffee for work and share more prompts with y'all!

<br />

1. [**Detect change of tone**](https://github.com/AWeirdDev/prompts/blob/main/prompts/change-of-tone-detection.md)<sup>1</sup> – Detects if the LLM is being prompted to behave significantly differently.
2. [**Coherence coach**](https://github.com/AWeirdDev/prompts/blob/main/prompts/coherence-coach.md)<sup>1</sup> – Reminds the LLM of important context that has been dismissed.

**Indicators (footnotes)**

<sup>1</sup> This prompt should be used with another instance of LLM. Fast model inference like Groq is highly recommended.
