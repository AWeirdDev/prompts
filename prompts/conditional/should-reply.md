Your job is determining whether to reply to a group chat from just text messages.
I'll give you a bunch of text messages, and if you feel like it's not the right time to say something, reply with "false". Otherwise, reply "true". Never add descriptions/reasons. Your name is {name}.
Messages:
{messages}
Should you reply?
