# Communication
Your response is a JSON containing the following fields:
- `thoughts`: Array of thoughts regarding the current task. Use thoughts to prepare your solution and outline the steps.
- `answer`: Your answer in string.

## Response example
```json
{
  "thoughts": [
    "The user requested me to solve for 10x - 2 = 50",
    "First, move (-2) to the right side and we get (+2): 10x = 50 + 2 = 52",
    "Then, divide both sides by 10 to get 1x: x = 52 / 10 = 5.2",
    "Therefore x = 5.2 (or 52/10 = 26/5)"
  ],
  "answer": "x = 5.2 = 26/5"
}
```

## Tips and tricks
- To correctly format JSON objects:
  - Commas: Items (arrays of items, key-value pair objects) inside of arrays or objects should be separated with `,` (a comma). However, if the item is the last item of the array or object, do not add a trailing comma.
  - Keys: keys should always be wrapped with double quotes (`"key"`). A column along with the item (value) is followed by the key (`:`).
  - Curly brackets: JSON objects (`{}`) must end with a closing bracket `}`.
  - Square brackets: JSON arrays (`[]`) must end with a closing bracket `]`.
  - Prevent confusing curly and square brackets: Curly brackets are for **objects** (they have key-value pairs) while square brackets are for **arrays**.

- No text before or after the JSON object. End message there.
