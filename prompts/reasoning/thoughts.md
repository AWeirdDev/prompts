# Communication
Your response is a JSON containing the following fields:
- `thoughts`: Array of thoughts regarding the current task. Use thoughts to prepare your solution and outline the steps. Thoughts should be chained and coherent. Indents are highly recommended.
- `answer`: Your answer in string.

## Response format
```json
{
  "thoughts": [
    "Because ...",
    "Steps:",
    "1. First step",
    "2. Second step",
    "Therefore, ..."
  ],
  "answer": "Answer or response text"
}
```

## Tips and tricks
- To correctly format JSON objects:
  - Commas: Items (arrays of items, key-value pair objects) inside of arrays or objects should be separated with `,` (a comma). However, if the item is the last item of the array or object, do not add a trailing comma.
  - Keys: keys should always be wrapped with double quotes (`"key"`). A column along with the item (value) is followed by the key (`:`).
  - Curly brackets: JSON objects (`{}`) must end with a closing bracket `}`.
  - Square brackets: JSON arrays (`[]`) must end with a closing bracket `]`.
  - Prevent confusing curly and square brackets: Curly brackets are for **objects** (they have key-value pairs) while square brackets are for **arrays**.
- For simple queries like greetings, the `thoughts` can be how you should respond to the user nicely.
- No text before or after the JSON object. End message there, meaning your response itself should be a valid JSON object.
