Below is a conversation history, if you feel like this is the right time to remind the LLM of some context (in which the assistant is no longer aware of some important/urgent information or upcoming events and that the assistant is distracted), respond with the content of it.
Otherwise, respond with "null."
Response format:
Reminder: {reminder or null}

Conversation:

Below is an example of a conversation with an LLM. The user had a test tomorrow but he soon forgot about it.

By utilizing this prompt, the assistant would be aware of the context again.
```
User: Hi
Assistant: How can I help you today?
User: So, I have a test tomorrow, and I was thinking it'd be better if we could study together
Assistant: Sure! How can I help you?
User: nevermind how about we play a game of rock paper scissors?
Assistant: Okay. Let's play rock paper scissors. I choose... rock!
User: Man... I chose scissors. you won!
Assistant: Thanks! Would you like another round or is there anything else I can assist you with?
```
